# GPS 1.1 Reflection

* What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  The only concept I really had issues with coming into the session was linking images using a relative path. I had gotten images to link, but didn't really understand what relative versus absolute paths were. 

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  As I said above, I didn't fully understand the relative linking. Luckily, Roche was driving at that point and just completed the relative linking quickly and easily, while describing simply "if it's in this same folder, I just need to type the name of the file". I don't even think she noticed my mind being blown by her describing it so easily. I went back to my exercises where I had to link images earlier this week, and realized I was using the absolute path. After this session, I was able to easily change those to the relative paths. 

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  We asked our guide a few simple questions when we were about to go down a rabbit hole, like "is it okay if we don't know exactly what the ls command stands for if we know what it does?". He was quiet and courteous, but definitely made our session run more smoothly. 

  I asked Roche a few questions about commands I wasn't 100% sure about and about the Markdown magic she was able to easily complete. 

* What still confuses you about git?
  I feel pretty comfortable with the aspects of git. The one part that confused me a little during this challenge was when we merged completely within git and not using github. I don't have a smooth handle on that flow, so will have to research a little before I nail it down. I don't know how much we'll be doing that anyways. 

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  I thought it was surprisingly easygoing, partially because working with Roche was so simple. She was positive and pleasant, even though it was nice and early for her. Since this challenge seemed a little light on challenging content, it was a little hard to make sure we were both engaged as driver/navigator.
