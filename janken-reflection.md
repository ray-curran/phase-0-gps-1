* What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Before the GPS session, I wouldn't say I was struggling with anything in particular, but I was feeling a little bit hazy about whether or not my workflow was seamless.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Ray showed me a rad Sublime shortcut--the tab complete that I've heard folks talking about on DBC videos but not explaining.  Winning!  Also, it was helpful to see what a merge conflict looked like within a document.  In addition, collaborating on the same repo was so easy!  It was great to experience the benefits of collaborating using GitHub after hearing about them all last week.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
James, our lovely guide, was rather quiet.  This challenge seemed pretty simple and Ray and I were able to answer one another's questions fairly easily.  I asked Ray about the difference between fetch and pull and he clarified that pull = fetch + merge.  Very helpful.

* What still confuses you about git?
I suspect that the deeper I get into git, the more confused I'll be, but at this point the workflow seems straightforward.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
This was my very first experience paring.  I had fun!  Ray and I quickly developed a nice repoire--we made jokes and worked through the releases smoothly.  I feel comfortable with this material, so I had to make a concious effort to work at a collaborative pace, rather than a solo pace--a bit more deliberate and leaving plenty of space for him to chime in, rather than moving quickly through the challenge.  Looking forward to continuing to pair program.
